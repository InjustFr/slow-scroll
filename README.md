# Slow Scroll

Better support for high res scrolling, making it easier to manipulate and place templates

## How To Use

By default, this module is deactivated even if enabled as it's settings are client based and not all touchpad and mice use high res scrolling. To enable it, go into your Foundry settings and uncheck **"Use Foundry's default behaviour"**. After that, the second setting will allow you to change the sensitivity of the preview

## Template Preview

As of now, this module only changes the speed at which the template preview rotates

## Compatibilites

This is at least compatbile with [DF Templates Enhancements](https://github.com/flamewave000/dragonflagon-fvtt/tree/master/df-templates) and should be with other modules manipulating template preview as well, as long as it's executing last. If you have any issues, try to deprioritize this module in your libwrapper settings
